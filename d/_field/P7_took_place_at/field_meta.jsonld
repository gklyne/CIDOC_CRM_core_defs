P7 took place at (witnessed) does not convey any meaning other than spatial positioning (generally on the surface of the earth).  For example, the period \"R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise\" can be said to have taken place in \"France\", the \"Victorian\" period, may be said to have taken place in \"Britain\" and its colonies, as well as other parts of Europe and north America.\r\n\r\nA period can take place at multiple locations.\r\n\r\n## Examples \r\n\r\n- the period \"R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise\" (E4) took place at France (E53)\r\n",
