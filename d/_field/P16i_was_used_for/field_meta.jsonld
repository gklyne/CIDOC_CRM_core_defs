  "rdfs:comment": "# P16 was used for\r\n\r\nThis property describes the use of material or immaterial things in a way essential to the performance or the outcome of an E7 Activity.\r\n\r\nThis property typically applies to tools, instruments, moulds, raw materials and items embedded in a product. It implies that the presence of the object in question was a necessary condition for the action. For example, the activity of writing this text required the use of a computer. \r\n\r\nAn immaterial thing can be used if at least one of its carriers is present. For example, the software tools on a computer.\r\n\r\nAnother example is the use of a particular name by a particular group of people over some span to identify a thing, such as a settlement. In this case, the physical carriers of this name are at least the people understanding its use.\r\n\r\n## Examples:\r\n\r\n- the writing of this scope note (E7) used specific object Nicholas Crofts' computer (E22)\r\nmode of use Typing Tool; Storage Medium (E55)\r\n- the people of Iraq calling the place identified by TGN '7017998' (E7) used specific object\r\n\"Quyunjig\" (E44) mode of use Current; Vernacular (E55)\r\n",
