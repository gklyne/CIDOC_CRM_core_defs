  "rdfs:comment": "# P4 has time-span\r\n\r\nThis property describes the temporal confinement of an instance of an E2 Temporal Entity. \r\n\r\nThe related E52 Time-Span is understood as the real Time-Span during which the phenomena were active, which make up the temporal entity instance. It does not convey any other meaning than a positioning on the \"time-line\" of chronology. The Time-Span in turn is approximated by a set of dates (E61 Time Primitive). A temporal entity can have in reality only one Time-Span, but there may exist alternative opinions about it, which we would express by assigning multiple Time-Spans. Related temporal entities may share a Time-Span. Time-Spans may have completely unknown dates but other descriptions by which we can infer knowledge. \r\n\r\n## Examples:\r\n \r\n- the Yalta Conference (E7) has time-span Yalta Conference time-span (E52)\r\n",
