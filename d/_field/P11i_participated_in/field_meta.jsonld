The property implies that the Actor was involved in the event but does not imply any causal relationship. The subject of a portrait can be said to have participated in the creation of the portrait.\r\n\r\n## Examples:\r\n\r\n- Napoleon (E21) participated in The Battle of Waterloo (E7)\r\n- Maria (E21) participated in Photographing of Maria (E7)\r\n",
