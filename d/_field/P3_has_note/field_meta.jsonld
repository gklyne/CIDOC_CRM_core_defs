In particular it captures the characterisation of the item itself, its internal structures, appearance etc.\r\n\r\nLike property P2 has type (is type of), this property is a consequence of the restricted focus of the CRM. The aim is not to capture, in a structured form, everything that can be said about an item; indeed, the CRM formalism is not regarded as sufficient to express everything that can be said. Good practice requires use of distinct note fields for different aspects of a characterisation. The P3.1 has type property of P3 has note allows differentiation of specific notes, e.g. \"construction\", \"decoration\" etc.\r\n\r\nAn item may have many notes, but a note is attached to a specific item.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n- coffee mug - OXCMS:1983.1.1 (E19) has note \"chipped at edge of handle\"\r\n",
