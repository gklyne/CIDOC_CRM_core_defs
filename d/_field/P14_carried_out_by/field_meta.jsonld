The P14.1 in the role of property of the property allows the nature of an Actor's participation to be specified.\r\n\r\n## Examples:\r\n\r\n- the painting of the Sistine Chapel (E7) carried out by Michaelangelo Buonaroti (E21) in the role of master craftsman (E55)\r\n\r\n## NOTE: \r\n\r\nThe RDF representation of CIDOC CRM does not currently support use of  P14.1, as there is no way to attach statements to a particular use of a property.  This kind of description can be created using a PROV qualified association.  See [this note](https://github.com/gklyne/DMO_Experiment/blob/master/CIDOC_CRM_PROV.md) for more information.\r\n",
