  "rdfs:comment": "# P8 witnessed\r\n\r\nThis property describes the location of an instance of E4 Period with respect to an E19 Physical Object.\r\n\r\nP8 took place on or within (witnessed) is a short-cut of a path defining a E53 Place with respect to the geometry of an object. cf. E46 Section Definition.\r\n\r\nThis property is in effect a special case of P7 took place at. It describes a period that can be located with respect to the space defined by an E19 Physical Object such as a ship or a building. The precise geographical location of the object during the period in question may be unknown or unimportant.\r\n\r\nFor example, the French and German armistice of 22 June 1940 was signed in the same railway carriage as the armistice of 11 November 1918.\r\n\r\n## Examples:\r\n\r\n- Westminster Abbey (E19) witnessed the coronation of Queen Elisabeth II (E7)\r\n\r\n## [GK Note]:\r\n\r\nThe intent seems to be a version of \"P7 took place at\" which refers to a physical thing rather than a physical location..  This property is an inverse which indicates an \"E4 Period\" that took place at or in a physical thing.\r\n\r\n",
